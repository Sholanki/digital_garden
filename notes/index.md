Welcome to my new notes hub. It sure feels redundant to have a blog, a wiki and a notes section so we'll see which mode wins out...

This section is entirely generated from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and I'll write more about that in the future.

Is this notes hub similar in essence to a [[Exploring digital gardens]]?

We'll see.

Some [[current interests]]:

- [[Strategy consulting]]
